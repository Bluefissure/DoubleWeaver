# DoubleWeaver

Double weaving in high latency network by subtracting the connection latency / action elapsing time from animation lock time.

### To Use

You must install **PingPlugin** for this plugin to work.

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DalamudPlugins/tree/Bluefissure#how-to-use) to add my custom repo in Dalamud.

### FAQ

#### 1. [What is the difference with NoClippy?](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DoubleWeaver/issues/1)

#### 2. [What happens if Ping Plugin value is inaccurate?](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DoubleWeaver/issues/4)

#### 3. Will I get banned (by FFLogs or SE)?

I don't think so, I've made lots of limitations to this tool to make sure it won't affect the animation lock too much.

If you still get banned from FFLogs, please submit a new issue and let me know what happened.

If you get banned by SE, it's more likely to be caused by other tools you used or get exposed that you're using third-party tools, which is not allowed by the game TOS.

### Relative Project

The idea is originally from [XivAlexander](https://github.com/Soreepeong/XivAlexander).

There's also another plugin [NoClippy](https://github.com/UnknownX7/NoClippy) which doesn't require PingPlugin.
