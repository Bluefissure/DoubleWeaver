# DoubleWeaver
Double weaving in high latency network.

Don't try to change the animation lock limitation in the code, or you are **cheating**.

**Use at your own risk.**

### To Use

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DalamudPlugins/tree/Bluefissure#how-to-use) to add my custom repo in Dalamud.

You may need to install **PingPlugin** for a better latency detection.

### Relative Project

The idea is original from [XivAlexander](https://github.com/Soreepeong/XivAlexander).
