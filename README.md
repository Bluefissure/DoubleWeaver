# DoubleWeaver

Double weaving in high latency network by subtracting the connection latency from animation lock time.

### FAQ

#### [The difference with NoClippy?](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DoubleWeaver/issues/1)

#### Will I get banned (by FFLogs or SE)?

I don't think so, I've made lots of limitations to this tool to make sure it won't affect the animation lock too much.

If you still get banned from FFLogs, please submit a new issue and let me know what happened.

If you get banned by SE, it's more likely to be caused by other tools you used or get exposed that you're using third-party tools, which is not allowed by the game TOS.

### Relative Project
